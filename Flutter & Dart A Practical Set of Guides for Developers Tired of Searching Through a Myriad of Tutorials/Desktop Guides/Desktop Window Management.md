# Desktop Window Management

When developing Flutter applications for desktop platforms, managing window properties is crucial for a polished user experience. One common issue is the lack of a default minimum window size. This guide will show you how to effectively manage desktop window properties using the `window_manager` package.

# WHY USE window_manager?

The [**window_manager**](https://pub.dev/packages/window_manager) package offers a comprehensive set of functions for controlling various aspects of desktop application windows. It allows you to:

- Set minimum and maximum window sizes
- Control window position and center it on screen
- Manage window focus and visibility
- Handle window events like resize or close

# INSTALLATION

Add `window_manager` to your `pubspec.yaml` file under `dependencies`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  window_manager: ^0.4.2  # Use the latest version available

```

# BASIC IMPLEMENTATION

Here's a basic example of how to use `window_manager` to set a minimum window size and center the window:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:window_manager/window_manager.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize window_manager
  await windowManager.ensureInitialized();

  // Configure window options
  WindowOptions windowOptions = const WindowOptions(
    minimumSize: Size(876, 654),
    center: true,
    backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
    skipTaskbar: false,
    titleBarStyle: TitleBarStyle.normal,
  );

  // Apply window options and show the window
  windowManager.waitUntilReadyToShow(windowOptions, () async {
    await windowManager.show();
    await windowManager.focus();
  });

  runApp(const MainApp());
}

class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Desktop Window Demo')),
        body: const Center(child: Text('Hello, Desktop!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

# CONFIGURATION EXPLANATION

- `minimumSize: Size(876, 654)`: Sets the minimum window size to 876x654 pixels.
- `center: true`: Centers the window on the screen when launched.
- `backgroundColor: Colors.transparent`: Sets a transparent background for the window.
- `skipTaskbar: false`: Ensures the app appears in the taskbar.
- `titleBarStyle: TitleBarStyle.normal`: Uses the default title bar style for the operating system.

# HANDLING DEBUG MODE

If you want different behavior during debug mode, you can use the `kDebugMode` constant:

```dart
WindowOptions windowOptions = WindowOptions(
  minimumSize: const Size(876, 654),
  center: kDebugMode ? false : true,
);

```

This will center the window only in release mode, which can be helpful during development to prevent the window from repositioning during hot reloads.

# ADVANCED FEATURES

`window_manager` offers many more features, including:

1. **Custom title bar**:
    
    ```dart
    await windowManager.setTitleBarStyle(TitleBarStyle.hidden);
    ```
    
2. **Full-screen mode**:
    
    ```dart
    await windowManager.setFullScreen(true);
    ```
    
3. **Always on top**:
    
    ```dart
    await windowManager.setAlwaysOnTop(true);
    ```
    

# KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Hot Reload Behavior**: The window may reset its position on hot reload. This is expected behavior in debug mode.
2. **Platform-Specific Behavior**: Some features may work differently across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Always test on all target platforms.

# CONCLUSION

Using `window_manager` provides fine-grained control over your Flutter desktop application's window properties. It allows you to create a more native-feeling desktop experience for your users. Remember to test your window management code thoroughly on all target platforms to ensure consistent behavior.
